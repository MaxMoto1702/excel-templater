== Introduction

This module exposes a Groovy DSL to create real Excel documents using
https://poi.apache.org/[Apache POI] under the hood. The goal of this
module is to abstract away the most common uses of
https://poi.apache.org/[Apache POI] to make creating Excel documents
very easy.

If you encounter any issues or inconsistencies while using this library,
or if you have a great idea for improving this library, please
